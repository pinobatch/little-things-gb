The story
---------

Once upon a time, three anthropomorphic brown bears (call them
Papa, Mama, and Cubby) lived in a cottage in the woods.  A
primary-school-age girl with long blonde hair was exploring park
trails in her area when she got lost and ended up on a trail spur
to the bears' cottage.  Finding the door not securely locked, she
"broke in", making herself at home while she got her head together.

When the bears returned from letting their meals cool, they followed
the shoeprints from the door and found that someone had made a
mess of the place, tasting their meals and eating all of Cubby's,
disturbing the chairs and breaking Cubby's, disturbing the bed
coverings.  They discovered the culprit lying in (you guessed it)
Cubby's bed and chased her out.  After their nerves settled, Papa
asked the others if he was too harsh.  Mama told Papa that she'd
told Cubby the story of Scrapefoot but never imagined she'd see it
play out in their own house.

A week later, the bears saw the girl in the park, and Cubby managed
to approach and exchange apologies with the girl, who said she goes
by Goldilocks.  Cubby explained that sometimes Papa's breakfast
isn't the only thing about him that's too hot.  Papa and Mama were
willing to forgive and forget the whole thing for the cost of a
replacement chair.  Gradually, Cubby and Goldilocks became friends.

Which brings us to today:  Goldilocks has been invited to the bears'
house for a play date, so long as she arrives at the right time.
