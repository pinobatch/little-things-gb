A bear on its hind legs is human-shaped, and a human on all fours
is bear-shaped.  A bear's omnivorous diet resembles that of a
preagricultural human.  A bear is fluffy, with a dog-like body under
all that fur.  Their small ears and chubby faces conserve heat while
retaining baby features that trigger a nurturing instinct.  Yet
despite being so friend-shaped, bears are vicious foquin predators.[^Leong]

One might conclude that it took a miracle for the Great Domestication
of the 19th century to occur.
