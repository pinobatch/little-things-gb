Border Crossing
===============

This is a tool to create your own Super Game Boy border to use in a
Game Boy game.  Load a border, then reset the flash cartridge or
hot-swap to the game you want to play.

A few sample borders are included.  These include the flags of
countries that border GitHub's home country and a few iconic computer
operating systems' window decorations.

How to use
----------

![The title screen of Border Crossing, showing a rectangle shaped like a TV and an arrow pointing to an illustration of a Game Pak. Cut to a list of borders: Canada, Classic Mac OS, macOS Big Sur, Mexico, Redmond 3.1, Redmond 98, Ross by Yoey, and a cursor moving down to Redmond 3.1. The border changes to a 1991-era desktop computer, and the interior shows "Swap paks now!" and a blinking dot at the lower right. Title "BORDER CROSSING" at the bottom disappears and "BUBBLE GHOST" appears. The screen changes to Bubble Ghost's title screen followed by its gameplay screen](docs/SwapToBubbleGhost.gif)

Dirt on connectors can sometimes freeze the SGB while performing a
pak swap.  Clean your cartridges' edge connectors with isopropyl
rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab first.  If the screen freezes,
turn off the Control Deck and try again.

1. Press the Start Button at the title screen.
2. Use the Control Pad to view border titles and choose one.
3. Press the A Button to preview the border.  To view another border,
   press the B Button to show the list.
4. Carefully remove the flash cartridge from your Super Game Boy's
   Game Pak slot and firmly insert another game.
5. Some games automatically start when inserted.  Other games show a
   title at the bottom of the screen.  Press the A Button to play.

A game with SGB enhancement will run without enhancement, so that it
does not overwrite your chosen border.

How to build
------------

Under Linux, install GNU Make, Coreutils, RGBDS 0.5 or 0.6, Python 3,
and Pillow (Python Imaging Library).  Then run `make`.

Adding borders
--------------

A border is 256 by 224 pixels and may have up to 256 distinct
8Ã—8-pixel characters.  Each character may use transparency and the
colors in one of three 15-color palettes.  Characters may be flipped
horizontally, flipped vertically, or reused with another palette.
The center 160 by 144 pixels should be transparent or mostly so,
as the game screen appears there.

In the present proof of concept, borders must be added in
`src/borderdata.z80` and `makefile`.  A future version may include a
tool to scan a folder for border images, convert them, and pack them
in a ROM.
