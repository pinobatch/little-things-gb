Border Crossing is pick a border, load a border, hot-swap to another
game, and play.

The most common color in the center 160x144 pixels becomes color 0
of all palettes.
If the image is smaller than 256x224 pixels, it is padded with the
darkest color in the image other than color 0.
If there are 16 or fewer colors in an image, the colors are mapped
1 to 1, except color 0 is swapped with color 0.
If the metadata provides several 15-color palettes, it uses them.
If there are more than 16, it attempts to pack palettes.  This takes
a while if it needs to step through a lot of randomly chosen
permutations.
