The play area (center 160x144 pixels) is a screenshot of a Pokémon
video game, consisting of an illustration of a monster, its
description, and the ornamentation of the "Pokédex" interface
through which the player views it.  The remainder is the border,
which illustrates the lens piece of a handheld video game console.
