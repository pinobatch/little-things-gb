There are 32 animated tiles. I've tried to put 2 of them on each of the top 16 rows of the playfield. Use a loop that copies 4 bytes per scanline, advancing once every 8 vblanks.

I have yet to draw animations for the bush and the left and right sides of the cloud.

The line at bottom says "TEARING: IS IT A PROBLEM?" advancing once every 16 vblanks.
