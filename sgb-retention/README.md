SGB Image Retention
===================

A game of peekaboo for your Game Boy compact video game system.

Hold the A Button to make Cubby go away on an original Game Boy or
Game Boy Color system.  Release the A Button to restore.

Notice that holding A doesn't do much on a Super Game Boy adapter
because SGB's scaler retains the picture from when the LCD was last
turned on.  There was [speculation by ISSOtm] that the SGB discards
the last picture after some time.  I failed to reproduce this
behavior.  If this is the case, it's longer than 20 seconds.
