"""Background

The system software of the Super Game Boy (SGB) accessory reads
the controller once per vertical blanking period and forwards
button states to the Game Boy (GB) system on chip.  This quantizes
the time when button states can change, and the program running
on the Game Boy can measure this.

The frame period, or the duration from the xtart of one vblank to
the next, depends on the model.  Ideal timer periods in units of
64 T-states (nominally 1/65536 second) rounded to a whole tick:

- NTSC SGB: 1117
- PAL SGB: 1330
- NTSC SGB2: 1090

SGB processing order varies a bit depending on other ongoing tasks.
In addition, the GB sees state changes only when the user actually
presses a button, or about one in 8-12 frames.  Estimation of
frame period must account for these sparse, noisy observations.
